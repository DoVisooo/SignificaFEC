Significa Frontend Challenge

I chose the Movie search challenge.

I chose to do this challenge in Visual Studio Code due to the reason that I've learned to do things like this in there.
I chose HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this challenge. I had to review some concepts and re-learn some things.

I challenged myself to complete this challenge in a day (~24 hours) and I was able to do it.
I think I wrote a solid application where I'm making API calls (I used OMDb API as suggested), filtering data and shape it to the display on the UI, saving local files with JSON in order to save information (favorites list).
I think the app design is simple, clean and objective.

I wrote an application with an Homepage containing a search field and a list with the results and favorites, an empty state, a loading state and movie not found state.
This application also contains a Movie details page where we can see movie's/series's/game's cover image, year, type and plot. We can also mark it as favorite there and search for more movies.

In order to try this application you just have to: 
1. Download these files:
  Homepage.html
  Details.html
  styles.css
  movie-search.js
  movie-details.js
2. Put them all inside a folder (empty if possible);
3. Open Homepage.html;
4. Start searching and adding to favorites.
